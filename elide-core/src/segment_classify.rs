//! Per-entry liveness classification — the shared logic that decides what
//! to do with an input segment's entries when rewriting that segment under
//! a fresh ULID.
//!
//! Used by every site that rewrites a segment under a new ULID:
//! coordinator-driven GC ([`crate::rewrite_plan`] / [`crate::rewrite_apply`]), redact,
//! sweep_pending, repack, and delta_repack. All four operations face the
//! same problem: the rewrite's new ULID sorts after every input ULID, so
//! on crash-recovery rebuild any entry the rewrite preserves competes with
//! later writes via `lbamap`'s last-write-wins rule. Stale LBA claims in
//! the rewrite would shadow genuine newer writes and corrupt the volume.
//!
//! The classifier walks each input entry against the current `lbamap`
//! (truth for "what hash should LBA X currently resolve to") and the
//! current `extent_index` (truth for "is this segment still the canonical
//! body for this hash"). It returns one of [`EntryClassification`]'s
//! variants, which the caller translates into a [`crate::rewrite_plan::PlanOutput`]
//! (or its in-memory equivalent for synchronous rewriters).
//!
//! The classifier is pure: no I/O, no state mutation. Caller threads the
//! `lbamap` / `extent_index` snapshots in via [`ClassifyCtx`].
//!
//! ## Multi-block partial-overwrite handling
//!
//! `Volume::write` writes a multi-block payload as one `Data` entry
//! covering N LBAs. A later write that overwrites only some of those LBAs
//! leaves the entry partially live. The classifier counts surviving
//! blocks via `lbamap.extents_in_range` (NOT a point query at
//! `start_lba`) and emits [`EntryClassification::PartialDeath`] with the
//! list of live sub-runs. The caller emits one Run per sub-run, each
//! carrying a `payload_block_offset` that the materialiser uses to slice
//! into the composite body.
//!
//! See `docs/design-gc-overlap-correctness.md` and
//! `docs/design-gc-partial-death-compaction.md`.
