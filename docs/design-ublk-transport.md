# ublk as an alternative transport

Status: exploration / pre-implementation reference. Captures the plan before any code changes.

## Framing

- ublk is a Linux userspace block device subsystem: kernel presents `/dev/ublkbN`, userspace daemon handles I/O over an `io_uring` passthrough channel on `/dev/ublkcN`.
- It is **host-side only**. From inside a VM we still need NBD (or vhost-user-blk).
- Goal: **ublk as preferred host-local transport; NBD stays for remote/VM**. Both first-class, not a replacement.
- **Transport is mutually exclusive per volume** — a writable volume is served on ublk *or* NBD, never both. Two transports would mean two independent page-cache views of the same backing data; serialising writes through `VolumeHandle` doesn't prevent stale reads on the other side.
- **Explicit transport choice for now.** Working toward ublk-by-default on Linux hosts, but the coordinator will not auto-pick until the ublk path is proven.

## Why it's worth doing

- 2–4× IOPS vs `nbd-client` on loopback and lower tail latency (no TCP, no socket wakeup, no serialised reply framing).
- Guest sees a real blk-mq device — partitions, `blkdiscard`, `fstrim`, `O_DIRECT`, `BLKZEROOUT` all work.
- Zero-copy WRITE path (`UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG`) lets guest pages flow into our hash/compress pipeline without a memcpy.
- Crash recovery (`UBLK_F_USER_RECOVERY_REISSUE`) pairs naturally with WAL idempotence + lowest-ULID-wins — a feature NBD cannot offer.

## Current NBD surface we need to match

All in `src/nbd.rs:handle_volume_connection` (src/nbd.rs:924). Every command maps 1:1 to a ublk op:

- `NBD_CMD_READ` → `UBLK_IO_OP_READ` → `VolumeHandle::read`
- `NBD_CMD_WRITE` → `UBLK_IO_OP_WRITE` → `VolumeHandle::write`
- `NBD_CMD_FLUSH` → `UBLK_IO_OP_FLUSH` → `VolumeHandle::flush`
- `NBD_CMD_TRIM` → `UBLK_IO_OP_DISCARD` → `VolumeHandle::trim`
- `NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES` → `UBLK_IO_OP_WRITE_ZEROES` → `VolumeHandle::write_zeroes`

The sub-4K RMW path (src/nbd.rs:1049) is NBD-only noise — ublk's `SET_PARAMS` pins logical block size to 4096 and the kernel won't issue sub-4K I/O.

## Architecture

- New module `src/ublk.rs` mirroring `src/nbd.rs` shape: `pub fn run_volume_ublk(dir, size_bytes, dev_id: Option<i32>) -> io::Result<()>`.
- Use `libublk` crate (Ming Lei — kernel maintainer; MIT/Apache; v0.4.x; active).
- One `io_uring` per queue, pinned to queue's affine CPU. Starting point: `nr_hw_queues = min(num_cpus, 4)`, `queue_depth = 64`, `max_io_buf_bytes = 1 MiB`. Tune later.
- I/O handler = thin adapter onto `VolumeHandle` — same shape as NBD transmission loop, different transport.
- **No shared transport trait up front.** Sockets vs io_uring + queue affinity are different enough that a trait is premature. Op dispatch is trivially the same; both call `VolumeHandle` directly.

## Async model

ublk's I/O transport is io_uring — async is inherent. But the async surface is **scoped to `src/ublk.rs`**; `VolumeHandle` and the rest of the core stay synchronous.

**Plan: A → B.**

- **A (spike, step 1).** libublk-rs as designed — one `io_uring` per queue, `smol::LocalExecutor` per queue thread, per-tag handler is `async fn` that `await`s FETCH_REQ, calls `VolumeHandle` synchronously, `await`s COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ. At `queue_depth = 1` a blocking backend call stalls only that queue's one in-flight op — acceptable for proving plumbing.
- **B (step 2).** Raise `queue_depth` and wrap backend calls in `spawn_blocking` (via the `blocking` crate) so the queue's executor can progress other tags in parallel. The actor already serialises at its mailbox, so concurrent blocking calls from N threads just queue up — same shape as today's NBD-per-connection threading.

**Why not C (hand-rolled sync io_uring loop).** Considered and rejected:

- Performance delta vs libublk-rs is in the noise. Async overhead is tens of ns per I/O; backend path (actor hop, WAL, occasional S3 fetch) dominates by orders of magnitude. Both B and C need a thread-pool offload for the backend anyway.
- Strictly more complex: we'd own the UAPI bindings, the FETCH/COMMIT tag state machine, the control-plane ioctl shapes, and the cost of tracking kernel protocol evolution (batched I/O, auto-buf-reg, new recovery modes). libublk-rs is maintained by the ublk driver's author.
- At `queue_depth > 1` with a thread-pool backend, we'd reinvent async by hand anyway.
- Escape hatch if libublk-rs is ever abandoned, not a starting point.

**Runtime coexistence.** libublk-rs uses `smol`; we already use `tokio` in the coordinator. No conflict — smol here is a thread-local executor, not a global runtime.

**Handle Send/Sync accommodation (follow-up).** `VolumeHandle` is `Send` but not `Sync` — it owns a `RefCell<FileCache>` (per-thread segment-fd LRU) by design; the comment at `elide-core/src/actor.rs:1343` captures this. `libublk`'s `run_target` requires the queue handler closure to be `Send + Sync + Clone + 'static`, so the spike wraps the handle in `Arc<Mutex<VolumeHandle>>` purely as a type-system accommodation — the lock is taken once per queue-thread startup to extract a fresh clone, never on the hot I/O path.

The right long-term shape is to split `VolumeHandle` into two types:

- `VolumeClient` (Send+Sync+Clone): mailbox channel, atomic snapshot pointer, immutable config. No per-thread state.
- `VolumeReader` (Send, !Sync): owns the per-thread file-fd cache; forwards writes via `Deref<Target = VolumeClient>`.

`actor::spawn` returns a `VolumeClient`; each thread calls `client.reader()` to get its reader. This removes the `Arc<Mutex<>>` at the transport boundary and matches the locality design intent already documented in `actor.rs`.

Trigger for landing the split: **either** raising ublk `queue_depth` / `nr_queues` past 1 in step 2, **or** adding a second transport (vhost-user-blk, iSCSI, …). Before either, the split is mechanical churn across ~30–50 call sites (NBD handler, coordinator, tests) serving a single use case; after, it pays off in every caller. Deferred to the step-2 PR at the earliest.

## Control plane

- Lifecycle: `ADD_DEV` → `SET_PARAMS` → `START_DEV` → run → `STOP_DEV` → `DEL_DEV`.
- Add `UblkConfig { dev_id: Option<i32> }` in `elide-core/src/config.rs` alongside `NbdConfig`. `ublk` and `nbd` sections are mutually exclusive in `volume.toml`; config parse rejects both being set.
- CLI: `--ublk` / `--ublk-id N`, conflicts with `--nbd-port` / `--nbd-socket` in clap.
- Conflict detection: `find_nbd_conflict` grows a `find_ublk_conflict` checking `dev_id`.
- Coordinator supervision unchanged: spawn `elide serve ... --ublk-id N`, respawn on crash.

## Crash recovery

- `UBLK_F_USER_RECOVERY_REISSUE`: kernel holds in-flight I/O across a daemon restart and re-issues to the new daemon.
- Safe because WAL + lowest-ULID-wins already handles duplicate writes (same LBA, same or newer ULID — idempotent).
- **Enabled by default.** Crash → coordinator respawns → kernel reissues → clean recovery. NBD cannot do this.
- Paired with a crash-injection test in the rollout (step 3) to validate before we rely on it operationally.

## Dependencies & platform gating

- Linux-only. New `libublk` dep behind `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` + cargo feature `ublk` (on by default on Linux, off elsewhere).
- Requires kernel 6.0+ with `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UBLK` (module shipped by Fedora 37+, Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.10+, RHEL 9+; `modprobe ublk_drv` on demand).
- Default mode: `UBLK_F_UNPRIVILEGED_DEV` (kernel 6.5+) so we don't demand `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. Zero-copy still requires root and is deferred as a future optional enhancement (step 4).
- Document `modprobe ublk_drv` + udev rules prereq in `docs/operations.md`.

## Testing

- Not runnable in `cargo test` sandbox — needs `/dev/ublk-control`, kernel module, udev perms. Treat like `nbd::tests`: sandbox-incompatible, run on a real Linux host.
- Minimal smoke: start ublk-backed volume, write pattern via `/dev/ublkbN` with `O_DIRECT`, read back, compare.
- Proptest coverage unchanged — it drives `VolumeHandle` directly, under the transport.

## Phased rollout

First PR is the spike only. Later steps are sequenced separately, each on its own PR.

1. **Spike (first PR).** Port NBD handler logic to a `libublk` handler. Single queue, depth 1, no zero-copy, no recovery. Against a ramdisk volume. Prove plumbing. (~1 day.)
2. **Multi-queue + depth.** Raise `nr_hw_queues` and `queue_depth`, verify under `fio`. Latency win should show here.
3. **USER_RECOVERY_REISSUE.** Coordinator calls `START_USER_RECOVERY` on respawn. Crash-injection test. Enabled by default once validated.
4. **Zero-copy (optional, future).** `UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG` on WRITE. Benchmark. Requires root — likely a separate "privileged" tier.
5. **Config + CLI.** First-class `ublk` section in `volume.toml` (mutually exclusive with `nbd`), coordinator lifecycle integration, docs.
